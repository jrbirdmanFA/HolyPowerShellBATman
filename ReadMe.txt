Greetings!

In this folder you will find materials from the DogFoodCon 2018 Session "Holy PowerShell, BATman!".

Not only is the PowerPoint deck included, but source for two of the three demos and bonus material.

* >Demo Scripts\String Parsing Interpolation and Formatting.ps1< is a standalone demonstration of how 
  PowerShell handles Command vs Expression string interpretation from the command line as well as string 
  interpolation and formatting.
* >\Magic8Ball< is a PowerShell script that simlulates the old Magic8Ball toy using four different approaches 
  and two different sources: text file and web service. It also includes a Visual Studio, .Net Core  project 
  that runs the web service. Instructions for starting and running it are in the \Magic8Ball\ReadMe.txt in the folder.

\Bonus Material contains a few extras: 
* a handy-dandy PowerShell Reference card published by DZone and Bruce Payette.  It's great to keep around, 
  especially when you don't code PowerShell scripts on a daily basis and need a quick refresher.
* Get-SystemInfo.ps1 -- a great example of using PS for creating a custom cmdlet, admin stuff, and script writing.

Except for the Bonus Material, these materials were written by me and are provided without warranty or support, 
but feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
