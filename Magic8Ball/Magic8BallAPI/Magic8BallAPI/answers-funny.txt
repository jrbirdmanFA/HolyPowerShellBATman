Si Amigo, like cheese on nachos
Smells like a yes
I got yes written on my forehead
I guess so, maybe
Yes! Hooray, Yipee!
Of course silly
My dog thinks so
Um.. Ok, sure, why not?
Will the sun rise tomorrow?
Yep, like a bird has feathers
When pigs fly!
No, but I still love you
Sorry, but no way
Never gonna happen
Ha Ha Ha, no!
Whatever
Give me a dollar, then I'll answer
I know, but I'm not telling
Go flip a quarter
What do you think?
